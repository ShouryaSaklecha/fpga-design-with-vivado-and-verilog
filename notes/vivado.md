# Vivado Gui Notes

## Schematic Tooling
Clicking RTL Analysis > Open Elaborated Design > Schematic allows to use:
1. See the gate level logic of verilog.
2. See the LUT to Logic mapping.

In tb, you can use:
1. force clock: create a signal to be a clock.
2. force signal: set a signal 1 or 0 as needed.

### Leaf Cells
In Vivado, a leaf cell represents the most fundamental unit of hardware logic that cannot be subdivided further within the design hierarchy. It is a primitive component that maps directly to the physical resources of the FPGA fabric such as look-up tables, flip-flops, or digital signal processing slices. These cells act as the functional building blocks where actual logic operations occur or where data is stored. Because they are at the bottom of the design tree, you can constrain their specific physical location on the chip, but you cannot look inside them for more granular logic modules.
### Nets
A net is the logical representation of a signal path that provides electrical connectivity between the pins of different cells. It functions as the virtual wire that carries data or clock signals from a single driver, such as an output pin of a flip-flop, to one or more loads, such as the input pins of a look-up table. In the Vivado database, nets are the objects used to analyze routing delays and congestion, as they define how signals navigate the FPGA interconnect fabric to link the various logic components together.

## Synthesis Tooling
Ensure TB code is under "simulation" and design under "Design Sources".

Converts FPGA code to set of primitives. **Does not place it on the FPGA yet.**

### Clocks and XDC
You should search for "master" xdc files by searching on google based on your board. The XDC files:
1. Have default clocking information.
2. Have some/or all, basic IO mapping.
3. You can find XDC files in the "Constraints" section

### I/O Planning
1. Check available ports
2. Add voltages etc to them etc.
3. Use xdc to find pin numbers (eg G15), to add pin
4. Use I/O standard to enter the IO Standard like LVCMOS32 etc.

### Post Synthesis Functional Verification
Done after TB, which is purely behavioural.
This verifies the functional verification of the FPGA based conversion.

## Implementation
Make sure your package pins for IO is specified **before** implementation.

You can see after implementation:
-  Where logic is placed on the actual board.
-  See nets/leaf cells etc.
- You can implement simulation on post implementation design too

## Bitsream
Generate the file for the FPGA
- Use hardware manager AFTER connecting the board to the PC.
- Hardware Manager > Program Device to burn the code
- Given you have switches etc I/O properlyh marked in the XDC, the code should now run on your board. 

## Waveform Viewer
- Using the <> arrows at a signal;, changes it to the next change of the signal
- Up down changes signal
- Ctrl allows use to move the marker and find thge time difference
- **Scope**: Highlights the top and daughter modules
- If a signal is not in the waveform, go to its module, right click > "Add to waveform"
- Change datatype by clicking on signal > radiux > type
- You can also change colours etc.
- Select "Analog" to also see transition like an analog signal

## Clocking in Waveforms in Multibit/Singlebit Signals
- Assign force clock to 1 bit port. If assigned to multibit, the LSB will become the clock, rest 0.
- Force constant: Will work properly as long as the port width is big enough for the constant.
- Prefer TB when size of data increases.

## RTL View
RTL View is a Register Transfer Level graphical representation of your design. This representation (.ngr file produced by Xilinx Synthesis Technology (XST)) is generated by the synthesis tool at earlier stages of a synthesis process when technology mapping is not yet completed. The goal of this view is to be as close as possible to the original HDL code. In the RTL view, the design is represented in terms of macro blocks, such as adders, multipliers, and registers. Standard combinatorial logic is mapped onto logic gates, such as AND, NAND, and OR.
## Post Synthesis View
Graphical representation of the post-synthesis (“optimized and mapped“) netlist (.ngc file produced by XST) contains Xilinx primitives as defined in the UNISIM library, such as LUTs, DCM, I/O buffers, and flip-flops. The Schematic Viewer allows you to visualize the primitive properties and the constraints attached to them.
